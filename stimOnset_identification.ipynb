    "- have a csv file containing 'correct' stim onsets/offset. There should be two stimulation per day for each patient\n",
    "- have a csv file reporting problematic dates per patient\n",
    "## Steps:\n",
    "- have box installed in the computer\n",
    "- import util functions\n",
    "- specify directory, target subjects, and output filenames (this is **important**!! otherwise overwriting happens)\n",

    "## Notes:\n",
    "- on mac, est 2hours per subj\n",
    "- we skip corrupted file\n",
